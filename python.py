# python:
    - it is a simple, high level, general purpose and object-oriented
    programming langauge.
    - it is a programming langauge with objects, modules, threads, exceptions
    and automatic memory management.
    - it used to code read-ability

# Features in Python:
    1. It is very easy to code in python language.
    2. Free and Open Source.
    3. Object-Oriented Language.
    4. GUI(Graphical User interfaces) Programming Support.
    5. High-Level Language.
    6. Python is  Extensible language.
    7. Python is Portable language.
    8. Python is Integrated language.
    9. Python is an Interpreted Language because Python code is executed line by line at a time.
    10. Python has a large standard library that provides a rich set of modules and functions
    11. Dynamically Typed Language.
    12. Frontend and backend development
    13. It is also a developer-friendly language.

# What’s the Difference Between Python 2.x and Python 3.x?

Basis of comparison	              Python 3	                           Python 2

Release Date	                   2008	                                2000

Function	                  print (“hello”)	                       print “hello”

Division of Integers	  Whenever two integers are divided,        When two integers are divided,
                            you get a float value.                  you always provide integer value

Unicode	                default storing of strings is Unicode.	    To store Unicode string value,
                                                                    you require to define them with "u".

Syntax	                The syntax is simpler and easily            The syntax is difficult to under-stand.
                            under-stand.

Rules of ordering       Rules of ordering comparisons have         Rules of ordering comparison are very complex.
Comparisons		            been simplified.

Iteration		        The new Range() function introduced         the xrange() is used for iterations.
                            to perform iterations.

Exceptions	            It should be enclosed in a parenthesis.	        It should be enclosed in notations.

Leak of variables	    The value of variables never changes.	        The value of the global variable will
                                                                    change while using it inside for-loop.

Backward 	                Not difficult to port python 2              Python version 3 is not backwardly
compatibility	          to python 3, but it is never reliable.           compatible with Python 2.

Library	              Many recent developers are creating libraries   Many older libraries created for Python 2
                        which you can only use with Python 3.	        is not forward-compatible.
